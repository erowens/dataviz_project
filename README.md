# Data Visualization Project
Code pertaining to the Final Project for MSDS 622 Data Visualization

Assignment Details:

Introduction:
You must include the following information but written out in paragraph format -
* What is this dataset?
* Where did you get it from?
* Why did you choose this particular data?
* If you brought in a second dataset such as census data, do the same for this one.
* What types of questions were you hoping to explore with this data?

Summary of Data:
Write out a summary of the information in the dataset, using visualizations to describe the data. These
need to clearly summarize the data but no storyline is needed. Make sure to include at least one of each
of these types of plots:
* Histogram
* Barplot
* Boxplot
* Scatterplot
* Bubble Map
* Chloropleth Map
* Connection Map
* Heat map
* Stacked area or stream graph
* Treemapping
* An interactive plot (can be combined with any of the above)

Your storyline:
Use a visualization and a written out explanation to tell a clear and compelling story that comes from a
unique insight from your data. This is a surprising and interesting insight that you wouldnâ€™t have gotten
from just a cursory glance at your data. This is viral blogpost worthy.
